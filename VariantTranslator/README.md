# VariantTranslator: A Generative AI Framework for Interpreting Genetic Variants
VariantTranslator is an advanced computational tool that bridges the gap between complex genetic testing results and meaningful clinical interpretation. This framework leverages generative AI to transform technical variant call format (VCF) data into accessible, personalized explanations tailored to different audiences.
The system parses genetic variant files to extract critical information about chromosomal positions, reference/alternative alleles, gene associations, and clinical significance. Using state-of-the-art generative language models, VariantTranslator produces plain-language interpretations that adapt to the reader's backgroundâ€”providing simplified explanations for patients and more technical details for healthcare providers.
Key features include comprehensive VCF parsing, audience-adaptive explanations, structured JSON reporting, and summary generation that highlights the most clinically relevant findings. By making genetic information more accessible, VariantTranslator helps patients better understand their genetic test results while giving clinicians efficient access to the technical details they need for informed decision-making.
This open-source framework supports the growing need for transparent communication of genetic information as genomic testing becomes increasingly common in healthcare settings.
